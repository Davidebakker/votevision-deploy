## Feedback

### Productkwaliteit (9.4, 9.7) - io
9.7 yet to be worked out

### Software analyseren (9.3) - on
Working on it
- only had research question formed and confirmed

### Software ontwerpen (9.2) - io

dependency injection and inversion ==> learn more about it.

logical architecture diagram ==> explore more about it.

JWT implemented

lambda expressions ==> try to implement some

complexity ==> perform code analysis, try using sonarqube

## Software realiseren (9.2, 9.3) - io
this was good enough
- no business logic in controller
- replace MYSQL with hibernate

### Software manage & control (9.6) - on
code review yet to be documented.

Testing ==> BE testing tried

FE yet to be implemented

### Infrastructuur ontwerpen en realiseren (9.2, 9.8) - io
working on deployment.
- Had docker file and image, but not running on the server

### Gebruikersinteractie realiseren (UI,UX) (9.4, 9.7) - io
this was good enough


## improvement
### Productkwaliteit (9.4, 9.7) - io
I didn't correctly understand 9.7, but every sprint we received feedback from the product owner (po). <br>
Beside that we requested a meeting with the po.

### Software analyseren (9.3) - on
I wrote the complete artikel but its yet to be reviewed.

### Software ontwerpen (9.2) - io
**dependency injection and inversion** <br>
I learn what the terms mean, so I can explain them and show them in the code.

**logical architecture diagram** <br>
yet to be done.

**lambda expressions** <br>
I already implemented it but I didn't know the term, so I couldn't explain it.

**complexity** <br>
downloaded sonarqube.

## Software realiseren (9.2, 9.3) - io
kept working on it.
- replaced a lot of MYSQL with hibernate.
- put a lot of business logic in the services instead of the controllers.

### Software manage & control (9.6) - on
As team we decided to document code reviews in merge requests.

**testing**
- Tried some more backend testing with Junit and Mockito
- Frontend testing yet to be implemented

### Infrastructuur ontwerpen en realiseren (9.2, 9.8) - io
have trouble with running the image on the oege server -> requested help from po

### Gebruikersinteractie realiseren (UI,UX) (9.4, 9.7) - io
this was good enough
- page is now fully responsive
- style is now also consistent
